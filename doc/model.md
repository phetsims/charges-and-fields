## Description of the model used in charges and fields

The model treats the electric charges as point charges of one nano Coulomb. Although the three dimensional Maxwell's
equations are used, the charges are confined to move along a two dimensional surface. The electric potential falls off
as 1/r away from a charge and the electric field falls off as 1/r^2. The numerical value for the electric potential and
electric field involves a sum over all charges of their individual potential (or field) contributions.

On some tablets, a maximum of 32 charges can be put on the board.
